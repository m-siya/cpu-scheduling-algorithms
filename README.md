# cpu-scheduling-algorithms
Implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms done as part of my Operating Systems Lab in 4th Semester of college.

### To-Do
- Improve cognitive complexity of round_robin.py run() method.
- Add implementation of pre-emptive priority scheduling algorithm.
- Add docstrings for each function of all algorithms.
- Separate Average waiting time and Average turn around time functions for each.
- Try to make Gantt charts as part of display function
