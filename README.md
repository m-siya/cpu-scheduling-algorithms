# cpu-scheduling-algorithms
Implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms done as part of my Operating Systems Lab in 4th Semester of college.

### To-Do
- [ ] Improve cognitive complexity of round_robin.py run() method.
- [x] Add implementation of pre-emptive priority scheduling algorithm.
- [ ] Add docstrings for each function of all algorithms.
- [ ] Add overhead option for each algorithm

- [ ] Separate Average waiting time and Average turn around time functions for each.
- [ ] Try to make Gantt charts as part of display function
- [ ] FCFS is broken right now. Need to fix it


# producer-consumer-problems
- [ ] clean up banker's algorithm into modules, add RL
